Hover on message container with an animated background and added all buttons for text formatting (looks good, does nothing-yet!)

To see all effects implemented:

Hover over details in the chat window by the channelinfo under the header.

Hover over all buttons in the message input area.

Hover over channels.

All done on the UI and nothing changed in the back-end because I am still getting the hang of git and I don't know how to work with it and wanted my project to stay on par with the tutorial and nothing clashing.
